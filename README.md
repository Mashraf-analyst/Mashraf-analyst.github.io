-   Sales Overview Performance Interactive Dashboard using PowerBI (Personal Project)

This project is self-taught and made using a dataset that is available online. I have learnt how to perform data cleaning, connection between tables, dashboard design, SQL query, and etc. The dashboard is interactive and responds to any filtering or query provided by user but using free version of PowerBI only allows me to showcase my result using screenshots of said table.
